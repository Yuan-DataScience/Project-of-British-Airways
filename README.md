# British Airways Customer Booking Prediction

This project is a part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage with British Airways. British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). It operates thousands of flights daily, carrying customers across the world. Understanding customer feedback and predicting booking behavior is crucial for improving customer satisfaction and optimizing operations.

## Project Description

The virtual internship involves two main tasks:
- **TASK 1**: Web scraping to gain company insights
- **TASK 2**: Predicting customer buying behaviour

## TASK 1: Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights

### Results

The frequency chart below shows that the key topics within the reviews include “service”, “seat”, “crew” and “staff”, showing that people are actively talking about their experience and staff.

## TASK 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour

The project tasks include:
1. **Scraping and collecting customer feedback** from the Skytrax website.
2. **Cleaning and analyzing the data** to extract insights using techniques like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and wordclouds.
3. **Building a predictive model** to forecast customer booking behavior using the provided dataset.
4. **Evaluating the model** and presenting the findings using visualizations and metrics.
